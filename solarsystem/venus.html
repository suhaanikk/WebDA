        Venus is often called Earth's twin because of its similar size and composition. <br>
        However, the planet's atmosphere is incredibly thick and made mostly of carbon dioxide, 
        trapping heat through a runaway greenhouse effect. <br>
        Venus rotates very slowly, taking 243 Earth days to complete one rotation, and its day is longer than its year.<br><br>
            <strong>Interesting Facts:</strong><br>
            - Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets (retrograde rotation).<br>
            - The surface temperature of Venus can reach 465°C (869°F), hot enough to melt lead.<br>
            - Venus has mountains, volcanoes, and craters, but no liquid water.<br>
